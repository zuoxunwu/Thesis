The W+W− candidates are selected in events with an oppositely charged lepton pair, large missing transverse momentum, and various numbers of jets. To select Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion and associated production with a W or Z boson, events with two jets or three or four leptons are also selected. The event sample corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 35.9fb−1, collected in pp collisions at s=13TeV by the CMS detector at the LHC during 2016. Combining all channels, the observed cross section times branching fraction is 1.28−0.17+0.18 times the standard model prediction for the Higgs boson with a mass of 125.09GeV. This is the first observation of the Higgs boson decay to W boson pairs by the CMS experiment.}

The H→ττ signal is established with a significance of 4.9 standard deviations, to be compared to an expected significance of 4.7 standard deviations.

The data correspond to integrated luminosities of 5.0 fb−1 at a centre-of-mass energy of 7 TeV and 19.7 fb−1 at 8 TeV for the μ+μ− search, and of 19.7 fb−1 at 8 TeV for the e+e− search. Upper limits on the production cross section times branching fraction at the 95% confidence level are reported for Higgs boson masses in the range from 120 to 150 GeV. For a Higgs boson with a mass of 125 GeV decaying to μ+μ−, the observed (expected) upper limit on the production rate is found to be 7.4 (6.5−1.9+2.8) times the standard model value. This corresponds to an upper limit on the branching fraction of 0.0016. Similarly, for e+e−, an upper limit of 0.0019 is placed on the branching fraction, which is ≈3.7×105 times the standard model value. These results, together with recent evidence of the 125 GeV boson coupling to τ-leptons with a larger branching fraction consistent with the standard model, confirm that the leptonic couplings of the new boson are not flavour-universal."

It has been designed and constructed to expose the physics models utilised, to handle complex geometries, and to enable its easy adaptation for optimal use in different sets of applications. The toolkit is the result of a worldwide collaboration of physicists and software engineers. It has been created exploiting software engineering and object-oriented technology and implemented in the C++ programming language. It has been used in applications in particle physics, nuclear physics, accelerator design, space engineering and medical physics."

Computer: Commodity PCs, Macs. Operating system: Linux, OS X; should also work on other systems. RAM: ∼10 megabytes Classification: 11.2. Does the new version supersede the previous version?: Yes Catalogue identifier of previous version: ACTU_v3_0 Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Comm. 178 (2008) 852 Nature of problem: High-energy collisions between elementary particles normally give rise to complex final states, with large multiplicities of hadrons, leptons, photons and neutrinos. The relation between these final states and the underlying physics description is not a simple one, for two main reasons. Firstly, we do not even in principle have a complete understanding of the physics. Secondly, any analytical approach is made intractable by the large multiplicities. Solution method: Complete events are generated by Monte Carlo methods. The complexity is mastered by a subdivision of the full problem into a set of simpler separate tasks. All main aspects of the events are simulated, such as hard-process selection, initial- and final-state radiation, beam remnants, fragmentation, decays, and so on. Therefore events should be directly comparable with experimentally observable ones. The programs can be used to extract physics from comparisons with existing data, or to study physics at future experiments. Reasons for new version: Improved and expanded physics models. Summary of revisions: Hundreds of new features and bug fixes, allowing improved modelling. Restrictions: Depends on the problem studied. Running time: 10–1000 events per second, depending on process studied."
