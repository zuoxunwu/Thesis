##Type A format:

1. Synchronized "nonzero", "nonprompt", "antiparticle" without hyphenation 

2. d0 -> d_0

3. In as many as possible places, changed "MC samples" to "simulations"

4. In as many as possible places, changed "Run 2 data" to "2016-2018 dataset" or similar descriptions

##Type B physics:

C1. Moved description of antiparticle to the last of the block 

C1S1. Added gamma matrices definition
      Removed mentioning of spacetime transformation
      Fixed descriptions

C1S2. Moved discussion of mass terms to the end to avoid confusions

C1S3. Replaced the U(1) symmetry breaking example with the SU(2)XU(1) breaking
      Corrected definition of Z 
      Expanded derivations of Yukawa coupling
      

C2. Small adjustment on descriptions in many places
C2S1. Added a short section on luminosity
