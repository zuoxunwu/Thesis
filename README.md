## Type A format:

1. Standardized "beamspot", "nonprompt", "antiparticle", "misreconstruction", "reweight", "subcategory" etc. without hyphenation 

2. No hyphenation "b jet" (by itself).

3. Hyphenated "b-jet ID" (attributive), "final-state", "long-lived", etc.

4. "Higgs mass" -> "Higgs boson mass", "Higgs decay" -> "Higgs boson decay", etc.

5. d0 -> d_0 (did not change plot labels)

6. In as many as possible places, changed "MC samples" to "simulations"

7. In as many as possible places, changed "Run 2 data" to "2016-2018 dataset" or similar descriptions

8. Fixed some "the" vs no article, and "that" vs "which", but unsure about many places. 

9. Reduced verbosity of text


## Type B physics:

All Chapters. Adjustments on descriptions following Darin's and Efe's comments

C1. Moved description of antiparticle to the last of the block 

C1S1. Added gamma matrices definition
      Removed mentioning of spacetime transformation
      Fixed descriptions

C1S2. Moved discussion of mass terms to the end to avoid confusions

C1S3. Replaced the U(1) symmetry breaking example with the SU(2)XU(1) breaking
      Corrected definition of Z 
      Expanded derivations of Yukawa coupling
      

C2S1. Added a short section on luminosity


C5S3. Added explanation on why ttH receive more improvements from GeoFit than ggH
