The Higgs boson was proposed in 1960s as one of the fundamental particles in the standard model (SM) of particle physics,
In 2012, the ATLAS and CMS experiments at the LHC discovered a scalar boson with a mass about 125 GeV 
which was later confirmed, through dedicated measurements of its properties, to be the Higgs boson of the SM.
One of the important properties of the Higgs boson is its coulping to muons, 
which is an elementary second generation fermion in the SM.
Any disagreement between the observed coupling and the SM prediction would indicate new physics phenomena beyong the SM,
while an agreement would further validate the SM and help measure parameters in the theory of Higgs physics.

This thesis reports the first evidence for the Higgs boson decay to a pair of muons,
based on the proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the LHC, 
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 $\text{fb}^{-1}$.
The analysis is performed in four exclusive categories targeting different production modes of the Higgs boson:
via gluon fusion, via vector boson fusion, in association with a vector boson, and in association with a top quark pair.
This thesis is focused on the exclusive category of the Higgs boson production in association with a vector boson,
in which an excess of events over the background expectation is observed in data with a significance of 2.0 standard deviations,
while the expected significance for the SM Higgs boson with mass of 125.38 GeV is 0.42 standard deviations.

The combination of the four exclusive categories yields an overall observed significance of 3.0 standard deviations, while the expectation is 2.5.
This result is also combined with the that from the data recorded at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 and 8 TeV, 
corresponding to integrated luminosities of 5.1 and 19.7 $\text{fb}^{-1}$, respectively,
whose effect is an increase in both the expected and observed significance by 1\%.
The measured signal strength. relative to the SM prediciton, is $1.19^{+0.40}_{-0.39} \text{(stat)}^{+0.15}_{-0.14} \text{(syst)}$.
This result establishes the first evidence for the Higgs boson decay to second generation fermions, with a branching fraction consistent with the SM prediction, 
and provides the most precise measurement of the Higgs boson coupling to muons up to date.
