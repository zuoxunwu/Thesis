\chapter{Introduction}

The success of modern particle physics has been a great success in describing the basic constituents of matter and the fundamental interactions between them.
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics summarizes the behavior of all observed elementary particles, shown in Figure~\ref{fig:SM_table}.
There are 12 types of elementary fermions, 4 types of elementary gauge bosons, and 1 Higgs boson.
Elementary fermions are matter particles and are further categorized into quarks and leptons.
Both quarks and leptons have 3 generations.
In each generation, there is a charge = $+\frac{2}{3}$ quark (u, c, and \Pqt quarks),
a charge = $-\frac{1}{3}$ quark (d, s, and \Pqb quarks), 
a charge = -1 lepton ($\Pe$, \mu, and \tau leptons),
and a neutral lepton ($\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$, and $\nu_{\tau}$ neutrinos).
Each of these particles has a counterpart called an anti-particle which has the same mass and spin as the particle itself, 
but opposite charge and other quantum numbers.
Gauge bosons have spin~=~1 are carriers of fundamental interactions: 
gluons for the strong interaction, photons for the electromagnetic interaction,
and \PW and \PZ bosons for the weak interaction.
Gravity is another fundamental interaction whose quantization has not been observed experimentally,
and is not included in the SM.
The Higgs boson is the only scalar boson (spin~=~0) in the SM.
It plays a special role in the SM as it interacts with all massive elementary particles 
and introduces the mechanism for them to have nonzero masses.
The anti-particles of gauge bosons and the Higgs boson are themselves.

The theory of the SM is formulated in quantum field theory and exhibits rich physics phenomena.
The mathematical construction of the SM is given in the following sections:
Section~\ref{sec:gauge_symmetry} describes the basic formalism of quantum field theory and the idea of gauge symmetry;
Section~\ref{sec:SM_Lagrangian} shows the mathematical description of the SM without the Higgs field and its drawback in describing particle masses;
Section~\ref{sec:Higgs_mech} introduces the Higgs field and its interplay with the gauge fields and fermion fields which allows particles to retain masses;
and Section~\ref{sec:SM_parameters} discusses the free parameters in the SM and the motivation to study the Higgs to muons decay.


\section{Quantum field theory and gauge symmetry}\label{sec:gauge_symmetry}

Symmetry is a key concept in physics. 
A symmetry regarding a certain quantity means the equations of motion do not depend on this quantity
and implies the existence of a conservation law.
Taking a free Dirac field for example, its Lagrangian is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Dirac_Lagrangian}
    \mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}(x)(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}-m)\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $\psi(x)$ is the Dirac field,
$\partial_{\mu}$ is the regular partial derivative with Lorentz index $\mu$,
$\gamma_{\mu}$ is the Dirac matrix of index $\mu$,
and $m$ is the mass of the Dirac spinor.
This Lagrangian is invariant under external spacetime translations or internal phase translations
\begin{equation}\label{eq:global_space}
     \psi(x) \to \psi(x+a_{0})
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:global_phase}
    \psi(x) \to e^{i\theta_{0}}\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $a_{0}$ and $\theta_{0}$ are arbitrary constants.
Such properties of invariance correspond to the conservations of energy, momentum, and probability current of free Dirac spinors.

Such symmetries are global symmetries as $a_{0}$ and $\theta_{0}$ are independent from the spacetime location.
A crucial practice in quantum field theory is to promote global symmetries to local symmetries, 
also known as gauge symmetries, under transformations like
\begin{equation}\label{eq:local_space}
  \psi(x) \to \psi(x+a(x))
\end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:local_phase}
 \psi(x) \to e^{i\theta(x)}\psi(x)
\end{equation}
where $a(x)$ and $\theta(x)$ are no longer constants but functions of the spacetime coordinates~$x$.
Obviously Equation~\ref{eq:Dirac_Lagrangian} is not invariant under these gauge transformations, 
as the transformations give rise the new terms of $\partial_{\mu}a(x)$ and $\partial_{\mu}\theta(x)$.
The way to achieve gauge invariance is to replace the partial derivatives $\partial_{\mu}$ by covariant derivatives, 
through whose construction new interactions are introduced.

The construction of spacetime gauge symmetry essentially leads to gravitation and is not the topic of this work.
Here we focus on the gauge invariance of transformation Equation~\ref{eq:local_phase}, 
and write the covariant derivative as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cov_de_phase}
    D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} + \text{i}eA_{\mu}
\end{equation}
where $e$ is an arbitrary constant and $A_{\mu}$ is a new field following the transformation
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EM_transformation}
    A_{\mu}(x) \to A_{\mu}(x) - \frac{1}{e}\partial_{\mu}\theta(x)
\end{equation}
In fact, this exact formula can be used to describe electromagnetism, 
for which $A_{\mu}$ is the vector potential of the electromagnetic field and $e$ is the electric charge.

Modifying Equation~\ref{eq:Dirac_Lagrangian} with Equation~\ref{eq:cov_de_phase} and adding the EM field term, 
we get a gauge invariant Lagrangian describing a Dirac field interacting with an EM field
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Dirac_EM}
    \mathcal{L} = \bar{\psi}(x)(i\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}-m)\psi(x) - \frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu}
\end{equation}
where $F_{\mu\nu}$ is the EM field tensor
\begin{equation}\label{eq:EM_tensor}
    F_{\mu\nu}(x) = \partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}(x) - \partial_{\nu}A_{\mu}(x) 
\end{equation}
The transformation Equation~\ref{eq:local_phase} takes the form of the group U(1) at each point $x$.
Therefore we say the electromagnetic interaction follows a U(1) gauge symmetry.



\section{The standard model Lagrangian}\label{sec:SM_Lagrangian}

Following the formalism in Section~\ref{sec:gauge_symmetry} and knowing there are 6 quarks, 6 leptons, and 4 gauge bosons,
the SM Lagrangian without considering a Higgs boson can be written as:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SM_Lagrangian}
  \begin{split}
    \mathcal{L} = & \bar{\psi}^{i} (i\gamma^{\mu})(D_{\mu})_{ij}\psi^{j} -
                  - \frac{1}{4} G^{k}_{\mu\nu}G^{k\mu\nu}
                  - \frac{1}{4} W^{a}_{\mu\nu}W^{a\mu\nu}
                  - \frac{1}{4} B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu} \\
                & - m_{f} \bar{\psi}^{i}_{f} \psi_{fi}
                  + \frac{1}{2} m^{2}_{G} G_{\mu}G^{\mu}
                  + \frac{1}{2} m^{2}_{W} W_{\mu}W^{\mu}
                  + \frac{1}{2} m^{2}_{B} B_{\mu}B^{\mu}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
In the equation:
\begin{itemize}
  \item $\psi$ is the fermion field and $D_{\mu}$ is the covariant derivative;
  \item $G^{k}_{\mu\nu}$, $W^{a}_{\mu\nu}$, and $B_{\mu\nu}$ are field strength tensors for the interaction fields 
        corresponding to the groups SU(3), an SU(2), and an U(1), respectively;
  \item $\mu$ and $\nu$ are the Lorentz vector indices. Index $k$ and $a$ are the index of the group generators, $k$ running from 1 to 8, and $a$ running from 1 to 3;
  \item $m_{f}$, $m_{G}$, $m_{W}$, and $m_{B}$ are the masses of the fermions and gauge bosons of SU(3), SU(2), and SU(1);  
\end{itemize}


This Lagrangian takes the structure of groups SU$(3)_{c} \times$SU$(2)_{L} \times$U$(1)_{Y}$.
The SU$(3)_{c}$ represents the strong interaction with the subscript $c$ standing for color.
The SU$(2)_{L} \times$U$(1)_{Y}$ is the electroweak interaction, 
where the $L$ means it only acts on left-handed fermions
and the $Y$ is the hypercharge associated with the U(1) group.\footnote{The hypercharge $Y$ is not the electric charge $e$ in Equation~\ref{eq:cov_de_phase}.
In fact, for all fermions, the electric charge $Q = T_{3} + Y/2$.}
Here the SU$(2)_{L} \times$U$(1)_{Y}$ cannot be disentangled and viewed separately as the weak interaction and electromagnetic interaction.

The gauge transformations on the fermion field are:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gauge_fermion}
  \begin{split}
    \text{U(1)}:  & ~~~~ \psi(x) \to  \text{exp}[i\theta_{Y}(x)Y]\psi(x) \\
    \text{SU(2)}: & ~~~~ \psi(x) \to  \text{exp}[i\theta^{a}_{L}(x)T^{a}]\psi(x) \\
    \text{SU(3)}: & ~~~~ \psi(x) \to  \text{exp}[i\theta^{k}_{c}(x)t^{k}]\psi(x) 
  \end{split}  
\end{equation}  
with $D_{\mu}$ taking the form of 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SM_cov_dev}
  D_{\mu} = \partial_{\mu} - ig^{\prime}B_{\mu}Y - igW^{a}_{\mu}T^{a} - ig_{s}G^{k}_{\mu}t^{k}
\end{equation} 
where $g^{\prime}$, $g$, and $g_{s}$ are field strength coefficients, 
and $Y$, $T^{a}$, and $t^{k}$ are interaction operators, for U(1), SU(2), and SU(3) respectively.
In this construction the transformations on the interaction fields are:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gauge_interaction}
  \begin{split}
    \text{U(1)}:  & ~~~~  B_{\mu}(x) \to B_{\mu}(x) + \frac{1}{g^{\prime}}\partial_{\mu}\theta_{Y}(x) \\
    \text{SU(2)}: & ~~~~  W^{a}_{\mu}(x) \to  W^{a}_{\mu}(x) + \frac{1}{g}\partial_{\mu}\theta^{a}_{L}(x) + \epsilon^{abc}W^{b}_{\mu}(x)\theta^{c}_{L}(x) \\
    \text{SU(3)}: & ~~~~  G^{k}_{\mu}(x) \to  G^{k}_{\mu}(x) + \frac{1}{g_{s}}\partial_{\mu}\theta^{k}_{c}(x) + f^{klm}G^{l}_{\mu}(x)\theta^{m}_{c}(x)
  \end{split}  
\end{equation}  
Furthermore, the field tensors in Equation~\ref{eq:SM_Lagrangian} are related to the field vectors as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:field_tensor}
  \begin{split}
    \text{U(1)}:  & ~~~~ B_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}B_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}B_{\mu} \\
    \text{SU(2)}: & ~~~~ W^{a}_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}W^{a}_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}W^{a}_{\mu} + g\epsilon^{abc}W^{b}_{\mu}W^{c}_{\nu} \\
    \text{SU(3)}: & ~~~~ G^{k}_{\mu\nu} = \partial_{\mu}G^{k}_{\nu} - \partial_{\nu}G^{k}_{\mu} + g_{s} f^{klm}G^{l}_{\mu}G^{m}_{\mu} 
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
in which the $\epsilon^{abc}$ and $f^{klm}$ are structure constants of SU(2) and SU(3) governing the relations between group generators
\begin{equation}\label{eq:struture_constant}
  \begin{split}
    [T^{a}, T^{b}] = i\epsilon^{abc}T_{c} \\
    [t^{k}, t^{l}] = if^{klm}t_{m}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

So far we have modeled the strong and electroweak interactions with matter fields.
However, the mass terms in the form of Equation~\ref{eq:SM_Lagrangian} are actually not gauge invariant.
For the gauge boson terms, $m^{2}_{G} G_{\mu}G^{\mu}$, $m^{2}_{W} W_{\mu}W^{\mu}$, and $m^{2}_{B} B_{\mu}B^{\mu}$,
it is already shown in Equation~\ref{eq:gauge_interaction} that the transformation of them always introduces terms depending on the transformation,
and is therefore not gauge invariant.
The fermion terms $m_{f} \bar{\psi}^{i}_{f} \psi_{fi}$ turn out not gauge invariant, either.
This is not so obvious in this form but becomes clear when written in left and right chiral forms: $\psi = \psi_{R} + \psi_{L}$
in which 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:psi_chiral}
    \psi_{R} = \begin{pmatrix} \psi_{+} \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}, 
    ~\text{and}~
    \psi_{L} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ \psi_{-} \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
We also introduce the projection operators:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:projection_op}
    P_{\pm} = \frac{1}{2}(1 \pm \gamma^{5})
\end{equation}
who act on $\psi$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:proj_psi}
  \begin{split}
    P_{+}\psi = \psi_{R}, & ~~~ P_{-}\psi = \psi_{L}, \\
    \bar{\psi}P_{+} = \bar{\psi_{L}}, & ~~~ \bar{\psi}P_{-} = \bar{\psi_{R}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
Expanding the term $m\bar{\psi} \psi = m(\bar{\psi_{R}} + \bar{\psi_{L}}) (\psi_{R} + \psi_{L})$,
the terms $\bar{\psi_{R}}\psi_{R}$ and $\bar{\psi_{L}}\psi_{L}$ vanish.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:RR_term}
    \bar{\psi_{R}}\psi_{R} = \bar{\psi} P_{-}P_{+} \psi = \bar{\psi} \frac{1}{4} (1 - (\gamma^{5})^{2}) \psi = 0
\end{equation}
The surviving terms $m\bar{\psi} \psi = m\bar{\psi_{R}}\psi_{L} + m\bar{\psi_{L}}\psi_{R}$
is not invariant under the SU$(2)_{L}$ transformation as it only acts on the left chiral component,
leaving uncancelled "phase" terms from the transformation.\footnote{The surviving terms of $\bar{\psi} (i\gamma^{\mu})(D_{\mu})\psi$
are $\bar{\psi_{R}} (i\gamma^{\mu})(D_{\mu})\psi_{R}$ and $\bar{\psi_{L}} (i\gamma^{\mu})(D_{\mu})\psi_{L}$, 
in which the SU$(2)_{L}$ "phase" term cancels properly, making them gauge invariant.}

Therefore, in this form of SM shown in Equation~\ref{eq:SM_Lagrangian}, all mass parameters $m_{f}$, $m_{G}$, $m_{W}$, $m_{B}$ should be 0,
which contradicts the experimental fact that most elementary particles are massive.
The follow section describes a mechanism to allow particles to retain masses 
through the introduction of a new field component called the Higgs field.


\section{The Higgs mechanism}\label{sec:Higgs_mech}

The Higgs field is a complex scalar field whose potential is:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:Higgs_potential}
    V(\Phi) = - \mu^{2} \Phi^{\dagger}\Phi + \lambda(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi)^{2}
\end{equation}
in which $\Phi$ is the complex scalar field and $\mu$, $\lambda$ are coefficients.
The shape of the this potential is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:Higgs_potential}. 
Parameter $\lambda$ needs to be positive for $V(\Phi)$ to have a minimum (ground state).
If $\mu^{2} \leqslant 0$, there is a single minimum of $V(\Phi)$ at zero when $|\Phi| = 0$.
If $\mu^{2} > 0$, $V(\Phi)$ can have a degenerate minimum of $-\frac{\mu^{4}}{4\lambda}$ when $\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi = \frac{\mu^{2}}{2\lambda}$.

\begin{figure*}[!htb]
  \centering
  \captionsetup{justification=justified}
  \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{pics/Intro/Higgs_field.pdf}
  \caption{The shape of the Higgs potential with different $\mu^{2}$ parameter configurations.}
  \label{fig:Higgs_potential}
\end{figure*}

The equation $\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi = \frac{\mu^{2}}{2\lambda}$ represents a circle in the complex plane of $\Phi$.
As $\mu^{2}$ increase from below 0 to above 0, 
the ground state of the field moves from $\Phi = 0$ in an arbitrary direction to a point on the circle $\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi = \frac{\mu^{2}}{2\lambda}$, 
making an asymmetric solution.
This phenomenon is known as the spontaneous symmetry breaking, 
which is also widely observed in physics systems such as the 
bending of a cylindrical rod under axial pressure,
or the cooling of a ferromagnetic material cross its Curie temperature.

Writing the Higgs field together with the simplest gauge field $A_{\mu}$, the Lagrangian is 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Higgs_gauge_Lag}
  \mathcal{L} = |(\partial_{\mu}+ieA_{\mu})\Phi|^{2} -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \mu^{2} \Phi^{\dagger}\Phi - \lambda(\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi)^{2}
\end{equation}
This Lagrangian itself is invariant under the U(1) gauge symmetry
\begin{equation}\label{eq:U1_trans}
    \Phi \to \text{exp}[i\theta(x)]\Phi, ~~~ A_{\mu} \to A_{\mu} - \frac{1}{e} \partial_{\mu}\theta(x)  
\end{equation}
but the symmetry breaks as the Higgs field takes a nonzero ground state.
The fields can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Higgs_perturb_form}
    \Phi(x) \to \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\rho(x)+v)\text{exp}[i\zeta(x)/v], ~~~~~
    A_{\mu} \to A_{\mu} - \frac{1}{ev} \partial_{\mu}\zeta(x)
\end{equation}
where $v = \frac{\mu^{2}}{\lambda}$ is known as the vacuum expectation value,
$\rho(x)$ and $\zeta(x)$ are scale and phase deviations from this ground state position.
The Lagrangian now becomes 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:local_Higgs_gauge_Lag}
  \begin{split}
    \mathcal{L} = & -\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}F^{\mu\nu} + \frac{1}{2} e^{2}v^{2}A_{\mu}A^{\mu} 
                    + e^{2}v \rho A_{\mu}A^{\mu} + \frac{1}{2} e^{2}\rho^{2}A_{\mu}A^{\mu} \\
                  & + \frac{1}{2} |\partial_{\mu}\rho|^{2} + \lambda v^{2} \rho^{2} 
                    - \lambda v \rho^{3} - \frac{1}{4} \lambda \rho^{4} + \frac{1}{4} \lambda v^{4}   
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
In this Lagrangian, a massive gauge boson term $e^{2}v^{2}A_{\mu}A^{\mu}$ appears,
and the $\rho$ becomes the apparent Higgs field.
This is a simple example but it already shows rich physics content:
it describes the coupling between the Higgs boson and the gauge boson $\rho A_{\mu}A^{\mu}$,
and the 4-point coupling $\rho^{2}A_{\mu}A^{\mu}$,
as well as the triple and quartic Higgs self-couplings, $\rho^{3}$ and $\rho^{4}$.
In particular, the term $\lambda v^{2} \rho^{2}$ describes the mass of the Higgs boson
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Higgs_mass}
    m_{H} = \sqrt{2\lambda} v
\end{equation}

Now we look at the real SM Lagrangian.
Putting the massless form of Equation~\ref{eq:SM_Lagrangian} together with the Higgs field, it becomes:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:SM_Lagrangian_Higgs}
  \begin{split}
    \mathcal{L} = &  - \frac{1}{4} G^{a}_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}
                     - \frac{1}{4} W^{a}_{\mu\nu}W^{a\mu\nu}
                     - \frac{1}{4} B_{\mu\nu}B^{\mu\nu} \\
                  & + |D_{\mu}\Phi|^2 + \mu^{2} \Phi^{\dagger}\Phi - \lambda (\Phi^{\dagger}\Phi)^{2} \\
                  & + \sum_{i} [\bar{\psi}^{i}_{R} (i\gamma^{\mu})(D_{\mu})\psi^{i}_{R} + \bar{\psi}^{i}_{L} (i\gamma^{\mu})(D_{\mu})\psi^{i}_{L}] \\
                  & - \sum_{i} g_{i} [\bar{\psi}^{i}_{R}\Phi^{\dagger}\psi^{i}_{L} + \bar{\psi}^{i}_{L}\Phi\psi^{i}_{R}]
  \end{split} 
\end{equation}
where the first and second lines are the gauge field and Higgs field similar to Equation~\ref{eq:Higgs_gauge_Lag},
the third line is the fermion kinetics written in the chiral form,
and the fourth line is the Yukawa coupling between fermions and the Higgs, also in the chiral form.
The index $i$ in the third and fourth lines just sums all fermions, 
with $g_{i}$ as the coupling strength for each fermion type.

\textbf{Masses of gauge bosons} come from the $|D_{\mu}\Phi|^2$ term, which expands to
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gauge_mass_term}
    |D_{\mu}\Phi|^{2} = \frac{1}{2}|\partial_{\mu}\rho|^{2} 
                       + \frac{1}{8}v^{2} [g^{2}(W^{1}_{\mu}W^{1\mu} + W^{2}_{\mu}W^{2\mu}) + (g^{\prime}B_{\mu}-gW^{3}_{\mu})^{2}]
\end{equation}
Defining the charged vector bosons as 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:W_boson_def}
    W^{\pm}_{\mu} = \frac{W^{1}_{\mu} \mp iW^{2}_{\mu}}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation}
the first term in Equation~\ref{eq:gauge_mass_term} becomes the mass term for the charged bosons with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:W_mass}
    m_{W} = \frac{vg}{2}
\end{equation}
Similarly, the cross terms in $(g^{\prime}B_{\mu}-gW^{3}_{\mu})^{2}$ can be eliminated by defining the neutral gauge bosons as
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    Z_{\mu} & = \text{cos}\theta_{W} B_{\mu} - \text{sin}\theta_{W} W^{3}_{\mu} \\
    A_{\mu} & = \text{cos}\theta_{W} B_{\mu} + \text{sin}\theta_{W} W^{3}_{\mu}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
with tan$\theta_{W} = g^{\prime}/g$, and the mass eigenvalues being
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    m_{Z} & = \frac{v\sqrt{g^{2}+g^{\prime 2}}}{2} \\
    m_{A} & = 0
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Masses of fermions} come from the Yukawa coupling term.
By plugging the perturbative form of of the Higgs field Equation~\ref{eq:Higgs_perturb_form} into the Yukawa term, it becomes
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Lagrangian_yukawa}
  \begin{split}
    \mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} & = \sum_{i} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} g_{i} (v+\rho) (\bar{\psi}^{i}_{R}\psi^{i}_{L} + \bar{\psi}^{i}_{L}\psi^{i}_{R}) \\
                                & = \sum_{i} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} g_{i} (v\bar{\psi}^{i}\psi^{i} + \rho \bar{\psi}^{i}\psi^{i})
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where the first part is the mass term for fermions, 
and the second part is the interactions between the apparent Higgs field $\rho$ and the fermions.
The fermion mass $m_{i}$ is proportional to its Yukawa coupling strength $g_{i}$
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fermion_mass}
    m_{i} = \frac{vg_{i}}{\sqrt{2}}
\end{equation} 
Note that the index $i$ does not run through neutrinos as they are assumed massless in the simplest form of SM.
But they can be included as an easy extension to the SM.

\textbf{The Higgs mass} comes from expanding the Higgs potential terms, 
which is explained in Equation~\ref{eq:Higgs_mass} and not repeated here.



\section{Parameters of the standard model}\label{sec:SM_parameters}

In the Lagrangian we derived in the last Section, there are 18 unconstrained real parameters (assuming massless neutrinos):
\begin{itemize}
  \item 3 gauge coupling constants $g$, $g^{\prime}$, and $g_{s}$;
  \item 2 Higgs potential shape parameters $\lambda$ and $\mu^{2}$;
  \item 9 Yukawa coupling constants $g_{i}$ for 3 charged leptons and 6 quarks;
  \item 4 parameters in the quark mixing matrix (CKM matrix) which is not elaborated here, including 3 angle parameters and 1 phase parameter.
\end{itemize}
These parameters determine the exact properties of SM particles and the measurements of them are a key topic of high energy experiments. 
In practice, some other variable sets are frequently used. 
For example, the parameter set $[g, g^{\prime}, \lambda, \mu^{2}, g_{i}]$ is interchangeable with 
the set consisting of the vacuum expectation, and the masses of Higgs, \PW, \PZ, and fermions $[v, m_{H}, m_{W}, m_{Z}, m_{f}]$.


The Higgs boson was first observed at the LHC by ATLAS and CMS Collaborations in 2012~\cite{Aad:2012tfa, Chatrchyan:2012xdj, Chatrchyan:2013lba}.
Various measurements on the Higgs properties have been conducted to verify their agreement with the SM prediction and to put constraints on the free SM parameters.
The latest and most precise measurement of the Higgs mass is $125.38 \pm 0.14$ \GeV, provided by the CMS Collaboration~\cite{2020135425}. 
The Higgs decays to gauge bosons and third-generation fermions (except the top quark) have been observed 
and measured~\cite{Sirunyan:2312121, 201996, Sirunyan:2017exp, PhysRevLett.121.121801, 2018283, PhysRevD.99.072001, 201859, 2019508, Aaboud_2018}.
The Higgs coupling to the top quark has has also been measured through the Higgs production process in association with a top quark pair~\cite{PhysRevLett.120.231801, 2018173}.
The Higgs coupling measurements from CMS with the LHC proton-proton collision data collected in 2016 is summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:higgs_2016},
in which, the gauge couplings and Yukawa couplings are expressed by the coupling modifiers 
($\kappa_{\PW}$, $\kappa_{\PZ}$, $\kappa_{t}$, $\kappa_{\tau}$, $\kappa_{b}$, and $\kappa_{\mu}$) in the \kappa-framework~\cite{Heinemeyer:2013tqa}.
This result confirms the proportionality between fermion masses and their coupling strengths to the Higgs boson,
a behavior predicted by the SM in Equation~\ref{eq:fermion_mass}.

The Higgs couplings to fermions of the first and second generations, 
however, are expected to be small and hard to probe.
The study of Higgs to muon decay is of particular importance 
as it is the most experimentally sensitive way to probe Higgs couplings to second-generation fermions.

This thesis presents the recent analysis of the Higgs to muons decay from CMS 
with a focus on the work in the vector boson associated Higgs production channel (VH).
The following chapters are organized as follows:
Chapter~\ref{chp:LHC_CMS} describes the LHC machine and the CMS detector,
Chapter~\ref{chp:hmm_overview} gives an overview of the \hmm analysis 
which is conducted in 4 exclusive event categories targeting different Higgs production modes,
Chapter~\ref{chp:objects} lists the reconstruction of physics objects and the selections on them in the analysis,
Chapter~\ref{chp:muon_corr} details the correction methods and calibration studies on the muon momentum which is crucial to the accuracy of this work,
Chapter~\ref{chp:VH_analysis} reports the full procedures of the analysis in the VH channel,
and Chapter~\ref{chp:hmm_results} summarizes the results from the VH analysis 
as well as the combined results of all 4 analysis channels.
